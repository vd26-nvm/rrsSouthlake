                <h2>Environment</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Did You Know? The average person generates 4.9 pounds of trash per day, according to the EPA. Most of this waste ends up in landfills, contributing to environmental pollution. But together, we can change that. Our mission is to significantly reduce the amount of waste we produce each day. Join us in making a positive impact on the environment—every small step counts.</p>

                <h2>Poverty</h2>
                <br>
                <p>A Growing Concern: Nearly 37 million people in the United States live below the poverty line, struggling to afford basic necessities like food, housing, and healthcare. For many, even the essentials are out of reach, leading to difficult choices and sacrifices. We are committed to addressing this issue by providing support and resources to those in need. Together, we can help create a more equitable and compassionate society where everyone has access to the essentials of life.</p>

                <h2>Art</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The Power of Art: Art is more than just a form of expression—it's a force that shapes culture, challenges perspectives, and inspires change. Studies show that communities with vibrant arts programs experience increased social cohesion, better mental health, and enhanced economic development. Art has the unique ability to bridge divides, spark dialogue, and foster empathy, making it a vital part of any thriving society. By supporting the arts, we nurture creativity and innovation, enriching the lives of individuals and communities alike.</p>
