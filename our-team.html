                <p class="descriptionFont">Hello! I'm Neha Arjun, a rising junior at Carroll
                    Senior High School. Joining the writing team at
                    Restoring Rainbows Southlake is a thrilling
                    opportunity for me to advocate for children in need
                    of quality school supplies. My background includes
                    writing in the medical field through programs at
                    Georgetown, the Center for Future Global
                    Leaders, and Scholar Launch, where I authored
                    published research articles on various medical
                    topics. I will also serve as a Blog Journalist &
                    Reporter for Pages of Youth and Neuro Notebook.
                    Currently, I'm working on my first novel.
                    Volunteering at Watermere, Harbor Chase, and
                    Texas Health allows me to meet individuals from
                    diverse backgrounds and understand the
                    challenges people face across different financial
                    classes, especially in education. My goal at RRS is
                    to bridge this gap by ensuring all students have
                    the necessary supplies to access education and
                    achieve their goals.
                    Fluent in English, Spanish, and Tamil, with basic
                    proficiency in Telugu and Hindi, I aim to use my
                    language skills to connect with international
                    communities at RRS, understand their struggles,
                    and empower them through education. Beyond
                    writing, Bharathanatyam allows me to express
                    myself creatively. Dance has taught me the
                    importance of artistic expression and finding inner freedom. At RRS, my aim is not only to
                    provide school supplies but also to equip children with a creative toolbox to paint a brighter
                    future for themselves and their families. Drawing from my experiences in writing, dance,
                    medicine, and volunteering, I aspire to offer a fresh perspective at RR to positively impact the
                    lives of children in our community, one crayon at a time.</p>

                    people over profit. Community service is also one of my great interests, as I am often

                    obstacle to pursuing their education, and this is an issue that I strongly believe RRS can address.
                    Social media is one of the most effective ways to spread awareness, and this is what I hope we
                    can accomplish. I'm also excited knowing that with Restoring Rainbows I can see the direct
                    impact with the community on this matter through projects like donation drives. I have done
                    similar volunteering through organizations like GRACE and their grocery drive. I believe I can

                <p class="descriptionFont px-12">Hey, my name is Vansh Patel and I have just started my junior year at Marcus High School in
                    Flower Mound. I am thrilled to be part of Restoring Rainbows as a Social Media Ambassador . As
                    someone who's active on social media I believe social media is the best way to spread the word
                    about Restoring Rainbows. With social media we can teach people about the amazing things we
                    have done and plan to do. At my school I am a member of DECA, HOSA, Science Club, and ASA.
                    Because of the many community events from these clubs, I found my passion for helping my
                    community and Restoring Rainbows has given me another chance to help my community by
                    providing millions of children in need with school supplies. By being a part of this amazing
                    group, I know we can make a change in our communities.</p>

                <p class="descriptionFont px-12">Hello! I’m Vidhan Desai, a senior at Ardrey Kell High School with a passion for exploring the intersections of technology and leadership. As an All Star Code Scholar, I found my interest in web development, where I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve had the opportunity to lead projects, such as designing navigation bars and coding key sections of web pages. My involvement in TSA led to placing 3rd at the North Carolina TSA competition in the Geospatial Technology category, a project that focused on analyzing the impact of hurricanes. Beyond technical skills, I’m actively engaged in community-driven efforts. I volunteer at Discovery Place Science and Idea Lab Kids, sharing my enthusiasm for STEAM with younger students, and as a result of several volunteering activites I have 2 Presidential Service Awards. Additionally, I am working with Technospire to manage and direct a local hackathon, aiming to provide students with opportunities to develop their skills in computer science.</p>
